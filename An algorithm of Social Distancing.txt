
A basic algorithm of Social Distancing in crowded areas


-The technique used:
bluetooth beacons.
android smart-phones.


-How does this technique work ?
In each EchoBeacon are set, through the provided App, several parameters, including: the size of the area , 
the timeframe and the number of Persons/Beacons allowed to be in the area in the same time; if these parameters are exceeded, 
the relay connected to an optical/acoustic alarm is activated in real-time & it could also send a notification in the app to the people to warn them
 to keep the social Distancing allowed when they do not follow it.



-What are the steps of this technique ?
1. Beacons broadcast a uniques identifies.
2. Smart-phones bluetooth beacons reads the unique identifier.
3. Smartphone wakes up the beacon enabled app.
4. The app recongnizes the beacon through its identifier.
5. The app reacts to inform the Bluetooth beacon
mac addresses
6. The system receives the information.
7.If the Social Distancing  is exceeded, 
the relay connected to an optical alarm is activated to inform the people . 
8.then ,this way goes back to the first step .


These steps are also simply explained in the flowchart (Attatched)
